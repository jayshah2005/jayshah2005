## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a software developer focusing on building full-stack applications that are fast, reliable, and scalable. I’m passionate about turning ideas into functional, real-world products.

I love building. Whether it's Java applications, full-stack React web apps, automations in n8n, games in Unity, ETL pipelines in Databricks, or dashboards in Power BI, I adapt quickly and find the levers that drive results.
